# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis & Text Processing using NLP  

This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on textual data using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.  
It also demonstrates a **text preprocessing pipeline** that includes:  
- Tokenization  
- Stopword Removal  
- Stemming  
- Lemmatization  

The cleaned and processed text is then used to analyze and classify sentiments such as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
